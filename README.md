Challenge 1


Hi Amy please create an account on our Dashboard. Once you’ve completed the signup process and acknowledged our terms, we’ll provide a live client_id, secret, and public_key on the Dashboard. This should resolve your issue accessing you item.
The difference between a public_token and a access_token is: 
public_token: A short-lived token that can be exchanged for an access_token or used to initialize Link in update mode for an Item.
access_token: A rotatable token unique to a single Item; used to access data for that Item.
Amy I do hope this answered your questions.
